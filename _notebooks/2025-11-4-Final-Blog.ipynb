    "In the begining of the year I did not know anything abut coding, terminal, or what vs code was. When we first started I was very confused on how to install everything we would need for this clss. I also didnt know how to do any coding when we started our first assignment. I didnt know anything when we started oir projet and I needed lots of help from others to make it easier for me. Over time I slowly learned more about coding and how to work in the terminal, as well as working in vs code. I Also learned more on how to code by my self and didnt require as much help from others as I did in the begining of the year. I also learned how to incorporate AI into my code to make it easier and faster to make. I also learned that I shouldnt rely on just AI becuase AI can make lots of mistakes and it would be harder to fix, so I only use AI to make a little bit of code and I would fix the code and add more to it and make it work."

I also rember variable which are things that you assign values to so when you put that variable it follows through with whatever value you gave it. The third thing I learned is using the terminal, I learned how to use terminal to open vs code and also set up repositories. I also learned How to navigate in the terminal which commands like ls and cd. These little things I learned made by coding experience easier and better."

I would also look at the comments that we got and implememnt those ideas into our game to hopefully make it better. I would really like to make this game  much better that it is right now and with less bugs and also make different cool things that could make better. If I would have to make another project I would probably want to make a game where you play as a charecter who goes around to collect different weapons by defeating enemies and go on to eventually fight a final boss that would finsih the game."
